# wod-notebooks
This project is the public notebook repo part of our Workshop-on-Demand setup.

## The repo contains a serie of public workshops.
A public workshop is a workshop that is based on open source technology. it does not require proprietary technology. As an example, API101 only requires a publicly available API to work. On the other side, a workshop requiring HPE OneView API endpoint can not be considered as public as it needs an HPE Propriatery technology to run.
A workshop is built up in its own directory: 
API101 Workshop example: WKSHP-API101/
The directory must be named with the prefix WKSHP- followed by some workshop name.


A workshop directory contains the following:

A series of Jupyter Notebooks: 

The naming convention requires a digit followed by WKSHP then lab part name It also includes details on notebooks technology and how to use them.

* 0-ReadMeFirst.ipynb => This notebook contains generic infos on the workshop. It introduces the subjects, the concepts as well as the flow of the workshop. A workshop can be made of several parts. 
* 1-WKSHP-REST_API_Basics.ipynb => Lab 1 of the Workshops. There coulb multiple labs, then part number would increment.
* 2-WKSHP-Conclusion.ipynb => Conclusion of the workshop summarizing the different steps achieved.
