    "The HPE Ansible Redfish [Gitub repository](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/ansible-ilorest-role) proposes three sets of Ansible Redfish Playbooks examples using:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * the iLOrest command\n",
    "  * the Redfish Galaxy collection\n",
    "  * Ansible modules derived from the [examples](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/python-ilorest-library/tree/master/examples/Redfish) of the `python-ilorest-library`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook, you will study an [Ansible Redfish playbook](3/set_uid_light.yml) based upon the [`set_uid_light.py`](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/python-ilorest-library/tree/master/examples/Redfish/set_uid_light.py) example of the the HPE [`python-ilorest-library`](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/python-ilorest-library/tree/master/). This python example has been modified to become an [Ansible module](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/ansible-ilorest-role/blob/master/library/set_uid_light.py). "
