The exhaustive list of possible commands is in the `CATEGORY_COMMANDS_ALL` array in the [module sources](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/blob/main/plugins/modules/remote_management/redfish/redfish_info.py). \n",
    "  * [Redfish command](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/redfish_command_module.html) - Performs `set` operations on log management, user management, and power operations (e.g. on, off, reboot, etc.). The exhaustive list of possible commands is in the `CATEGORY_COMMANDS_ALL` array in the [module sources](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/blob/main/plugins/modules/remote_management/redfish/redfish_command.py) \n",
    "  * [Redfish config](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/redfish_config_module.html) - Performs configuration operations on BIOS and other subsystems. The exhaustive list of possible commands is in the `CATEGORY_COMMANDS_ALL` array in the [module sources](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/blob/main/plugins/modules/remote_management/redfish/redfish_config.py) \n",
    "  \n",
    "The above Ansible Redfish modules, are based upon the [redfish_utils.py](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/blob/main/plugins/module_utils/redfish_utils.py) python utility module.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Redfish Ansible Playbook examples using the above modules are present in the [DMTF Redfish-Ansible-Playbooks](https://github.com/DMTF/Redfish-Ansible-Playbooks) public GitHub repository.\n",
