# {{ BRANDINGWOD }} Challenge

The challenge consists of:
* A worskhop to complete
* A simple quiz to answer

To complete the workshop, you need to go through the different labs that make up the workshop. Labs are made of cells that needs to be executed. The quiz is related to the workshop you have selected. There are only a few questions to answer (up to 3 maximum).

# Introduction to Python
In this workshop we’ll go through the basics of the Python programming language. You'll learn about variables and data types, as well conditionals and loops, among many other things. 

# Authors: [Samarth Deyagond](mailto:samarth.deyagond@sap.com) and [Didier Lalli](mailto:didier.lalli@hpe.com)

## Handouts
You can freely copy these Jupyter Notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.
- Install the Jupyter Notebook application from [here](https://jupyter.org/install) 
- A Beginners Guide is available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)


## Lab flow
{{ BRANDINGWOD} Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files that always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the TS sessions, we leverage an infrastucture that uses a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides are stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).

In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:

• A notebook is a series of cells

• The notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the notebook)

• A cell can be either markdown or code (in the selected kernel)

• To run a cell use:

    o The Play button at the top
    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)
    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)
    
• Running a markdown cell just renders it

• Running a code cell runs the code and displays the output just below the cell

• When a cell is running, it displays an [*] to its left. Then, when finished, it displays a counter of the number of executions of that cell

• You cannot run a cell when another is already running, but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button

Enjoy the labs ! :-)
