# HPE Developer Workshop



# Introduction to Python for High Performance Computing (HPC)
In this workshop we’ll go through some of the advantages and disadvantages of using Python for HPC and scientific computing, and how you can get better performance from your Python applications.

## Handouts
You can freely copy the Jupyter Notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.
- You can download the Jupyter Lab application from [here](https://jupyter.org/install). 
- A Beginners Guide is also available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)
- A previous Workshop-on-Demand introducing Jupyter is available [here](https://hackshack.hpedev.io/workshop/25)
- For real beginners, there is also a [Python 101 HPE Developer Workshop-on-Demand](https://developer.hpe.com/hackshack/workshop/15) available from [here](https://hackshack.hpedev.io/workshop/15)

## Lab flow
HPE Developer Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files which always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the training environment, this year we decided to innovate and introduce a brand-new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).

In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:

• A Notebook is a series of cells

• Notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the Notebook)

• Cell can be Markdown or Code (in the selected kernel)

• To Run a cell use:

    o The Play Button at the top
    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)
    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)
    
• Running a markdown cell is just rendering it.

• Running a Code cell runs the code and display the output just below the cell.

• When a cell is running it displays a [*] to its left, then when finished, it displays a counter of the number of execution of that cell.

• You cannot run a cell when another is already running, but you can interrupt a running cell with the "stop" button.

Enjoy the labs ! :-)
