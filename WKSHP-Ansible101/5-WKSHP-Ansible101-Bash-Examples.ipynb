You can also use multiple inventory files at the same time as described in Using multiple inventory sources, and/or pull inventory from dynamic or cloud sources or different formats (YAML, ini, and so on), as described in Working with dynamic inventory. Introduced in version 2.4, Ansible has Inventory plugins to make this flexible and customizable."
