    "I want to automate specific sub-sets of my inventory. How do I use patterns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ansible works against multiple managed nodes or “hosts” in your infrastructure at the same time, using a list or group of lists known as inventory. Once your inventory is defined, you use patterns to select the hosts or groups you want Ansible to run against.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default location for inventory is a file called /etc/ansible/hosts. You can specify a different inventory file at the command line using the -i <path> option. You can also use multiple inventory files at the same time as described in Using multiple inventory sources, and/or pull inventory from dynamic or cloud sources or different formats (YAML, ini, and so on), as described in Working with dynamic inventory. Introduced in version 2.4, Ansible has Inventory plugins to make this flexible and customizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case: We are leveraging the Ansible Jupyter Kernel present on our jupyterhub server. Therefore, the target will be the jupyterhub server in all the labs, with the execption of the last one that will leverage proper based Bash ansible commands on a remote target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ansible Playbooks offer a repeatable, re-usable, simple configuration management and multi-machine deployment system, one that is well suited to deploying complex applications. If you need to execute a task with Ansible more than once, write a playbook and put it under source control. Then you can use the playbook to push out new configuration or confirm the configuration of remote systems. The playbooks in the ansible-examples repository illustrate many useful techniques. You may want to look at these in another tab as you read the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Playbooks can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* declare configurations\n",
    "* orchestrate steps of any manual ordered process, on multiple sets of machines, in a defined order\n",

    "By default, Ansible executes each task in order, one at a time, against all machines matched by the host pattern. Each task executes a module with specific arguments. When a task has executed on all target machines, Ansible moves on to the next task. You can use strategies to change this default behavior. Within each play, Ansible applies the same task directives to all hosts. If a task fails on a host, Ansible takes that host out of the rotation for the rest of the playbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a playbook, Ansible returns information about connections, the name lines of all your plays and tasks, whether each task has succeeded or failed on each machine, and whether each task has made a change on each machine. At the bottom of the playbook execution, Ansible provides a summary of the nodes that were targeted and how they performed. General failures and fatal “unreachable” communication attempts are kept separate in the counts.\n"
