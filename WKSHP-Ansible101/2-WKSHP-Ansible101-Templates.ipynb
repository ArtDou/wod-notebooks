    "\n",
    "Ansible uses variables to manage differences between systems. With Ansible, you can execute tasks and playbooks on multiple different systems with a single command. To represent the variations among those different systems, you can create variables with standard YAML syntax, including lists and dictionaries. You can define these variables in your playbooks, in your inventory, in re-usable files or roles, or at the command line. You can also create variables during a playbook run by registering the return value or values of a task as a new variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "![AnsibleVariable](Pictures/ansible101-3.PNG) \n",
    "\n",
    "After you create variables, either by defining them in a file, passing them at the command line, or registering the return value or values of a task as a new variable, you can use those variables in module arguments, in conditional “when” statements, in templates, and in loops. [The ansible-examples github repository](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples) contains many examples of using variables in Ansible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you understand the concepts and examples on this page, read about Ansible facts, which are variables you retrieve from remote systems. With Ansible you can retrieve or discover certain variables containing information about your remote systems or about Ansible itself. Variables related to remote systems are called facts. With facts, you can use the behavior or state of one system as configuration on other systems. For example, you can use the IP address of one system as a configuration value on another system. Variables related to Ansible are called magic variables."

    "In this part, we will leverage a template file (jinja Template with j2 extension) that will be used to create the final file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most powerful way to manage files in ansible is to template them. with this method, you can write a template configuration file that is automatically customized for the managed host when the file is deployed, using ansible variable and facts. This can be easier to control and less error-prone. Ansible uses the jinja2 templates for template files. Jinja2 is a modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python frameworks. It is widely used for dynamic file generation based on its parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jinja2 Language Definition\n",
    "Jinja2 is a very powerful and advanced templating language from python. It is very fast, reliable and widely used to generate dynamic data. It is a text-based template language and thus can be used to generate any markup as well as source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ansible, most of the time we would use templates to replace configuration files or place some other files such as scripting, documents and other text files on the remote server. Let’s see more about how it fit in ansible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features of Jinja2\n",
    "* Control structures (loops and conditional statements)\n",
    "* Template inheritance\n",
    "* Support for custom filters\n",
    "* Rich set of built-in filters\n",
    "* configurable syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Delimiters Used in Jinja 2\n",
    "1. {{ '{%' }} {{ '%}' }} : used for control statements such as loops and if-else statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. {{ '{{' }} {{ '}}' }} :These double curly braces are the widely used tags in a template file and they are used for embedding variables and ultimately printing their value during code execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. {{ '{#' }} {{ '#}' }} used for comments which are not included in the template output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The file extension of a jinja2 template is .j2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jinja2 Templates\n",
    "Jinja2 templates are simple template files that store variables that can change from time to time. When Playbooks are executed, these variables get replaced by actual values defined in Ansible Playbooks. This way, templating offers an efficient and flexible solution to create or alter configuration file with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our current jupyterhub setup leverages a lot of these templates to build up the necessary automation to deploy the server itself and the notebooks you are currently reading :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the Virtual Machine IP Address that you will use as a Ansible Target for the workshop is defined as {{ '{{' }} IP-WKSHP-Ansible101 {{ '}}' }}  in the raw version of the notebook. When ansible deploys / copies the notebook to your student folder as part of our overall workshop deployment automation, it substitutes this variable present in the notebook by the one listed in the dedicated variable file : 16.31.86.90\n"
