    "I want to automate specific sub-sets of my inventory. How do I use patterns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ansible works against multiple managed nodes or “hosts” in your infrastructure at the same time, using a list or group of lists known as inventory. Once your inventory is defined, you use patterns to select the hosts or groups you want Ansible to run against.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default location for inventory is a file called `/etc/ansible/hosts`. You can specify a different inventory file at the command line using the -i <path> option. You can also use multiple inventory files at the same time as described in Using multiple inventory sources, and/or pull inventory from dynamic or cloud sources or different formats (YAML, ini, and so on), as described in Working with dynamic inventory. Introduced in version 2.4, Ansible has Inventory plugins to make this flexible and customizable.\n",

    "## Modules and Commands\n",
    "    \n",
    "Ansible works by connecting to your nodes and pushing out scripts called “[Ansible modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/list_of_all_modules.html)” to them. Most modules accept parameters that describe the desired state of the system. Ansible then executes these modules (over SSH by default), and removes them when finished. Your library of modules can reside on any machine, and there are no servers, daemons, or databases required.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write your own modules, though you should first consider whether you should. Typically you’ll work with your favorite terminal program, a text editor, and probably a version control system to keep track of changes to your content. You may write specialized modules in any language that can return JSON (Ruby, Python, bash, and so on).\n",

    "\n",
    "By default, Ansible executes each task in order, one at a time, against all machines matched by the host pattern. Each task executes a module with specific arguments. When a task has executed on all target machines, Ansible moves on to the next task. You can use strategies to change this default behavior. Within each play, Ansible applies the same task directives to all hosts. If a task fails on a host, Ansible takes that host out of the rotation for the rest of the playbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a playbook, Ansible returns information about connections, the name lines of all your plays and tasks, whether each task has succeeded or failed on each machine, and whether each task has made a change on each machine. At the bottom of the playbook execution, Ansible provides a summary of the nodes that were targeted and how they performed. General failures and fatal “unreachable” communication attempts are kept separate in the counts.\n",

    "## Playbooks\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ansible Playbooks offer a repeatable, re-usable, simple configuration management and multi-machine deployment system, one that is well suited to deploying complex applications. If you need to execute a task with Ansible more than once, write a playbook and put it under source control. Then you can use the playbook to push out new configuration or confirm the configuration of remote systems. The playbooks in the [ansible-examples repository](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples) illustrate many useful techniques. You may want to look at these in another tab as you read the documentation. This is where Ansible starts to get most interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Playbooks can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* declare configurations\n",
    "* orchestrate steps of any manual ordered process, on multiple sets of machines, in a defined order\n",
    "* launch tasks synchronously or asynchronously\n",
    "\n",
    "Ansible’s approach to orchestration is one of finely-tuned simplicity, as we believe your automation code should make perfect sense to you years down the road and there should be very little to remember about special syntax or features.\n",
    "\n",
    "A playbook contains a list of tasks  (plays) in an order they should get executed against a set of hosts or a single host based on the configuration specified.  Playbooks are text files written in YAML, in an easy human-readable syntax having the following constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* start with three dashes (---)\n",
    "* A proper indentation using spaces and not tabs!\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "You can consider ansible ad-hoc commands as shell commands and a playbook as a shell script. In this Shell script analogy, many shell commands put together in the form of shell script to perform a set of tasks and they also give us benefits like conditional statements, loops, functions etc.\n",
