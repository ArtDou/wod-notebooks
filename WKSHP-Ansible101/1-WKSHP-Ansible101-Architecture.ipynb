    "# Ansible101: A simple Introduction to Ansible Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "# Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "Forewords:\n",
    "We won't be covering the installation part of Ansible in this workshop. We will be leveraging the ansible engine available on our Jupyterhub server. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are willing to perform the ansible packages installation, you can either use regular distribution package mechanism or pip. Both will provide you with the necesarry packages to run you own tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ansible is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being designed for multi-tier deployments since day one, Ansible models your IT infrastructure by describing how all of your systems inter-relate, rather than just managing one system at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses no agents and no additional custom security infrastructure, so it’s easy to deploy - and most importantly, it uses a very simple language ([YAML](https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started), in the form of Ansible Playbooks) that allow you to describe your automation jobs in a way that approaches plain English.\n",
    "\n",
    "![AnsibleArchi](Pictures/Ansiblearchi1.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modules\n",
    "Ansible works by connecting to your nodes and pushing out scripts called “[Ansible modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/list_of_all_modules.html)” to them. Most modules accept parameters that describe the desired state of the system. Ansible then executes these modules (over SSH by default), and removes them when finished. Your library of modules can reside on any machine, and there are no servers, daemons, or databases required.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write your own modules, though you should first consider whether you should. Typically you’ll work with your favorite terminal program, a text editor, and probably a version control system to keep track of changes to your content. You may write specialized modules in any language that can return JSON (Ruby, Python, bash, and so on).\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look now at some of the modules HPE provides to System Admins:\n",
    "* [HPE Alletra 9000 and HPE Primera and HPE 3PAR Modules for Ansible](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/hpe3par_ansible_module)\n",
    "* [Ansible Modules for HPE SimpliVity](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/simplivity-ansible)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collections\n",
    "[Collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/index.html) are a distribution format for Ansible content. You can package and distribute playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins using collections. A typical collection addresses a set of related use cases. For example, the HPE OneView collection automates management of HPE OneView instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Ansible Collection for HPE OneView](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/oneview-ansible-collection)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a collection and publish it to Ansible Galaxy or to a private Automation Hub instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Module utilities\n",
    "When multiple modules use the same code, Ansible stores those functions as [module utilities](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/list_of_utilities_modules.html) to minimize duplication and maintenance. For example, the code that parses URLs is `lib/ansible/module_utils/url.py`. You can write your own module utilities as well. Module utilities may only be written in Python or in PowerShell.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plugins\n",
    "[Plugins](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.4/dev_guide/developing_plugins.html) augment Ansible’s core functionality. While modules execute on the target system in separate processes (usually that means on a remote system), plugins execute on the control node within the `/usr/bin/ansible process`. Plugins offer options and extensions for the core features of Ansible - transforming data, logging output, connecting to inventory, and more. Ansible ships with a number of handy plugins, and you can easily write your own. For example, you can write an inventory plugin to connect to any datasource that returns JSON. Plugins must be written in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inventory\n",
    "By default, Ansible represents the machines it manages in a file (INI format) that puts all of your managed machines in groups of your own choosing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add new machines, there is no additional SSL signing server involved, so there’s never any hassle deciding why a particular machine didn’t get linked up due to obscure NTP or DNS issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there’s another source of truth in your infrastructure, Ansible can also connect to that. Ansible can draw inventory, group, and variable information from sources like EC2, Rackspace, OpenStack, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what a plain text inventory file looks like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[webservers]\n",
    "www1.example.com\n",
    "www2.example.com\n",
    "\n",
    "[dbservers]\n",
    "db0.example.com\n",
    "db1.example.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once inventory hosts are listed, variables can be assigned to them in simple text files (in a subdirectory called ‘group_vars/’ or ‘host_vars/’ or directly in the inventory file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, as already mentioned, use a dynamic inventory to pull your inventory from data sources like EC2, Rackspace, or OpenStack.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Roles\n",
    "\n",
    "Roles let you automatically load related vars, files, tasks, handlers, and other Ansible artifacts based on a known file structure. After you group your content in roles, you can easily reuse them and share them with other users.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default Ansible will look in each directory within a role for a main.yml file for relevant content (also main.yaml and main):\n",
    "\n",
    "![AnsibleRole](Pictures/ansible101-2.PNG) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `tasks/main.yml` - the main list of tasks that the role executes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `handlers/main.yml` - handlers, which may be used within or outside this role.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `library/my_module.py` - modules, which may be used within this role (see Embedding modules and plugins in roles for more information).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `defaults/main.yml` - default variables for the role (see Using Variables for more information). These variables have the lowest priority of any variables available, and can be easily overridden by any other variable, including inventory variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `vars/main.yml` - other variables for the role (see Using Variables for more information).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `files/main.yml` - files that the role deploys.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `templates/main.yml` - templates that the role deploys.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `meta/main.yml` - metadata for the role, including role dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Playbooks\n",
    "Playbooks can finely orchestrate multiple slices of your infrastructure topology, with very detailed control over how many machines to tackle at a time. This is where Ansible starts to get most interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ansible’s approach to orchestration is one of finely-tuned simplicity, as we believe your automation code should make perfect sense to you years down the road and there should be very little to remember about special syntax or features.\n",
    "\n",
    "A playbook contains a list of tasks  (plays) in an order they should get executed against a set of hosts or a single host based on the configuration specified.  Playbooks are written in YAML, in an easy human-readable syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "You can consider ansible ad-hoc commands as shell commands and a playbook as a shell script. In this Shell script analogy, many shell commands put together in the form of shell script to perform a set of tasks and they also give us benefits like conditional statements, loops, functions etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, Ansible Playbooks are a group of ad-hoc commands with additional programming elements like loops, iterations, conditionals etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s what a simple playbook looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "- hosts: webservers\n",
    "  serial: 5 # update 5 machines at a time\n",
    "  roles:\n",
    "  - common\n",
    "  - webapp\n",
    "\n",
    "- hosts: content_servers\n",
    "  roles:\n",
    "  - common\n",
    "  - content\n",
    "```  \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Ansible uses variables to manage differences between systems. With Ansible, you can execute tasks and playbooks on multiple different systems with a single command. To represent the variations among those different systems, you can create variables with standard YAML syntax, including lists and dictionaries. You can define these variables in your playbooks, in your inventory, in re-usable files or roles, or at the command line. You can also create variables during a playbook run by registering the return value or values of a task as a new variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you create variables, either by defining them in a file, passing them at the command line, or registering the return value or values of a task as a new variable, you can use those variables in module arguments, in conditional “when” statements, in templates, and in loops. \n",
    "\n",
    "![AnsibleVariable](Pictures/ansible101-3.PNG) \n",
    "\n",
    "## Templates\n",
    "\n",
    "The most powerful way to manage files in ansible is to template them. with this method, you can write a template configuration file that is automatically customized for the managed host when the file is deployed, using ansible variable and facts. This can be easier to control and less error-prone. Ansible uses the jinja2 templates for template files. Jinja2 is a modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python frameworks. It is widely used for dynamic file generation based on its parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jinja2\n",
    "Jinja2 is a very powerful and advanced templating language from python. It is very fast, reliable and widely used to generate dynamic data. It is a text-based template language and thus can be used to generate any markup as well as source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ansible, most of the time we would use templates to replace configuration files or place some other files such as scripting, documents and other text files on the remote server. Let’s see more about how it fit in ansible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features of Jinja2\n",
    "* Control structures (loops and conditional statements)\n",
    "* Template inheritance\n",
    "* Support for custom filters\n",
    "* Rich set of built-in filters\n",
    "* configurable syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Delimiters Used in Jinja 2\n",
    "1. {{ '{%' }} {{ '%}' }} : used for control statements such as loops and if-else statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. {{ '{{' }} {{ '}}' }} :These double curly braces are the widely used tags in a template file and they are used for embedding variables and ultimately printing their value during code execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. {{ '{#' }} {{ '#}' }} used for comments which are not included in the template output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The file extension of a jinja2 template is .j2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jinja2 Templates\n",
    "Jinja2 templates are simple template files that store variables that can change from time to time. When Playbooks are executed, these variables get replaced by actual values defined in Ansible Playbooks. This way, templating offers an efficient and flexible solution to create or alter configuration file with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our current jupyterhub setup leverages a lot of these templates to build up the necessary automation to deploy the server itself and the notebooks you are currently reading :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the Virtual Machine IP Address that you will use as a Ansible Target for the workshop is defined as {{ '{{' }} IP-WKSHP-Ansible101 {{ '}}' }}  in the raw version of the notebook. When ansible deploys / copies the notebook to your student folder as part of our overall workshop deployment automation, it substitutes this variable present in the notebook by the one listed in the dedicated variable file : 16.31.86.90\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Ansible search path\n",
    "Modules, module utilities, plugins, playbooks, and roles can live in multiple locations. If you write your own code to extend Ansible’s core features, you may have multiple files with similar or the same names in different locations on your Ansible control node. The search path determines which of these files Ansible will discover and use on any given playbook run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ansible’s search path grows incrementally over a run. As Ansible finds each playbook and role included in a given run, it appends any directories related to that playbook or role to the search path. Those directories remain in scope for the duration of the run, even after the playbook or role has finished executing. Ansible loads modules, module utilities, and plugins in this order:\n",
    "\n",
    "Directories adjacent to a playbook specified on the command line. If you run Ansible with ansible-playbook /path/to/play.yml, Ansible appends these directories if they exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "*`/path/to/modules`\n",
    "*`/path/to/module_utils`\n",
    "*`/path/to/plugins`\n",
    "\n",
    "Directories adjacent to a playbook that is statically imported by a playbook specified on the command line. If play.yml includes - import_playbook: /path/to/subdir/play1.yml, Ansible appends these directories if they exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "*`/path/to/subdir/modules`\n",
    "*`/path/to/subdir/module_utils`\n",
    "*`/path/to/subdir/plugins`\n",
    "Subdirectories of a role directory referenced by a playbook. If play.yml runs myrole, Ansible appends these directories if they exist:\n",
    "\n",
    "*`/path/to/roles/myrole/modules`\n",
    "*`/path/to/roles/myrole/module_utils`\n",
    "*`/path/to/roles/myrole/plugins`\n",
    "Directories specified as default paths in ansible.cfg or by the related environment variables, including the paths for the various plugin types. See Ansible Configuration Settings for more information. Sample ansible.cfg fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "* DEFAULT_MODULE_PATH\n",
    "* DEFAULT_MODULE_UTILS_PATH\n",
    "* DEFAULT_CACHE_PLUGIN_PATH\n",
    "* DEFAULT_FILTER_PLUGIN_PATH\n",
