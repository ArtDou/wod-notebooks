## Handouts
You can freely copy these Jupyter Notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.
- Install the Jupyter Notebook application from [here](https://jupyter.org/install) 
- A Beginners Guide is available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)


## Lab flow
HPE Developer Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files that always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into TS sessions, we leverage an infrastructure that uses a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides are stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).

In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:

• A notebook is a series of cells

• The notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the notebook)

• A cell can be either markdown or code (in the selected kernel)

• To run a cell use:

    o The Play button at the top
    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)
    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)
    
• Running a markdown cell just renders it

• Running a code cell runs the code and displays the output just below the cell

• When a cell is running, it displays an [*] to its left. Then, when finished, it displays a counter of the number of executions of that cell

• You cannot run a cell when another is already running, but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button

Enjoy the labs ! :-)
