    "In this workshop, you’ll get to see how Project Data Map can help you discover new and meaningful datasets that enhance your model building experience, all whilst keeping track of the datasets you know and love, so next time you don’t have to go digging through old notebooks to find them! You’ll even learn how you can share them with your classmates or trade them for valuable tokens!\n",
