    "## Objectives of the Docker Lab\n",
    "At the end of the Lab students should be able to install Docker, use the CLI to create a new image, a container, launch an application in it, store data, configure the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Lab is intended to be trial and error so that during the session students should understand really what is behind the tool.  Blindly following instructions is not an effective way to learn IMHO. You've been warned ;-)\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected duration : 120 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reference documents\n",
    "When dealing with the installation and configuration of Docker, the first step  is to check the reference Web site http://docker.io/:\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of each section there is an estimate of how long it will take to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Note on Linux commands\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are familiar with Linux, you can skip this section. If not please read to understand some commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a number of places, the lab uses the Linux here pattern to create text files, as in the following example,\n",
    "\n",
    "`#` **`cat > fileToCreate << EOF`**\n",
    "```none\n",
    "Text line 1\n",
    "Text line 2\n",
    "EOF\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will create the text file `fileToCreate` and populate it with the lines of text that follow up but not including the EOF keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can display the content of the created file with the command `cat fileToCreate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to append text to the file, the first `>` can be replaced with `>>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer, you can edit the files using **vim** or **nano** text editors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## But I'm a poor lonesome Windows cowboy !\n",
    "\n",
    "Well in that case, first condolences, then read the fine document made by Michael Mayer at https://github.com/bcornec/Labs/blob/master/Docker/LabOnWindows.md to get help.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Environment setup\n",
    "Estimated time: 15 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to the instructions available at https://github.com/bcornec/Labs/blob/master/ENVIRONMENT.md\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Docker is also providing the possibility to have a web based access to an on demand infrastructure for 4 hours. This is available at http://play-with-docker.com. Check that as a fallback you can use it and create up to 5 nodes with it. Become familiar to use this or your platform of choice for the rest of the Lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proxy consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is usually run in our environment that has a direct access to the Internet. If you want to run this lab on your site behind a corporate proxy, you will have to configure your Linux distribution and Docker to access the Internet via your proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following instruction are available for a Centos 7 distribution, because instructions on the Docker part are systemd based.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Get the proxy IP and port.\n",
    " 2. Make sure your host can resolve the proxy address using `nslookup <proxy>`, if not use the proxy IP.\n",
    " 3. Configure your Linux package manager to go through the proxy by exporting the http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "export http_proxy=http://<proxy name or ip>:<proxy port>\n",
    "export https_proxy=http://<proxy name or ip>:<proxy port>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. Configure Docker daemon to use the proxy as explained by this document: https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/systemd/#http-proxy (in short add Environment=\"HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:80/\" \"HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:80/\" to your [services] section)\n",
    "<!-- Previous version\n",
    " 5. **Set the proxy in each of your Dockerfiles** by adding following text as the 2nd and 3rd line of the Dockerfile.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ENV http_proxy <HTTP_PROXY>\n",
    "ENV https_proxy <HTTP_PROXY>\n",
    "```\n",
    "-->\n",
    " 5. Build Dockerfile with the appropriate arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Docker installation\n",
    "Docker is available externally from http://docs.docker.com/linux/step_one/ or using your distribution packages, or from github at https://github.com/docker/docker\n",
    "Version 19.03 is the current stable release. This lab requires at least version 1.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask to your instructor which Linux distribution will be used for the Lab (Docker in Docker, Ubuntu or CentOS). Then refer to the corresponding instructions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other distributions should be as easy to deal with once the same packages have been installed using the package manager as they should be available directly (Case of most non-commercial distributions such as Debian, Fedora, Mageia, OpenSUSE, ...). Follow the instructions from https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Docker in Docker installation\n",
    "\n",
    "As the docker image already provides the required packages, you just need to check that docker is running and at the correct minimal version. Go to the Check installation paragrah below for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ubuntu installation\n",
    "If you work on an Ubuntu environment for the Lab, you may want to use apt to do the installation of Docker with all its dependencies. As Ubuntu provides an old version of Docker, we will use a PPA providing a more up to date version:\n",

    "The application is still a WIP/Demo, so don't worry with all the additional files and directories for now. Upstream is at https://github.com/uggla/openstack_lab.git alongside its documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need first to run the application locally using the compose file, in order to create all the Docker images and to upload them into the registry.\n",

    "`#` **`./docker_services.sh`**\n",

    "\n",
    "A customer of a big e-commerce site receives a promotional email with a link to win a prize if they are lucky.\n",
    "The application detects whether the player already played or not, and whether he won already or not.\n",
    "Each status is kept with the date when it was performed. The application provides a button allowing the customer to play, in case he didn't already, and the result of the computation which happens behind the scene is given back to the customer: it is the nature of the article he has won, and the corresponding image is displayed in the interface. Mails are sent to admins when a winner is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "That application is made of one Web page with 5 parts/micro-services: I, S, B, W and P:\n",
    "  - I(dentification) service: receives http request from customer (link with customer ID) and look for it into the DB.\n",
    "  - S(tatus) service: detect whether customer already played or not, status stored in the DB. It is using a messages bus to buffer requests.\n",
    "  - B(utton) service: button widget allowing the customer to play. Only when not already done.\n",
    "  - W(orker) service that computes whether the customer won or not (slow service on purpose with a REST API interface), called by B. If won, post an image representing what has been won into an object store with customer ID. Then post by e-mail via an external provider a message to admins (using a messages bus). Button is gray if the customer has already played. W and the DB are on a separate private network.\n",
    "  - P(icture) service: Look into the object store with customer ID to display the image of the customer's prize, empty if no image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each part of the web page is implemented as a micro-service. So the application supports nicely the death of any one of the 5 micro-services. The page is still displayed anyway, printing N/A when a micro-service is unavailable. In case of insufficient resources (as with the slow W micro-service), we will look at how to scale that application.\n",

    "Please have a look at the `docker_services.sh` script and adapt what needs to be changed for your environment at the start in case of issues.\n",
