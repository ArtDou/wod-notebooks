    "In this workshop, we will learn the basics on Machine Learning by being hands-on - no math knowledge required!!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create some basic machine learning models and use them to make predictions.\n",

    "We are NOT attempting to teach you to become a datascientist!!\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "the following lab could run from your laptop or from binder but we adapted it to fit in our overall workshop infrastructure.\n",
