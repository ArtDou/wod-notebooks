This is not by any means a super deep dive but hopefully will explain why stackstorm should be in your automation toolbag. \n",

    "HackShack Workshops are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files which always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the TS sessions, this year we decided to innovate and introduce a brand-new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).\n",
